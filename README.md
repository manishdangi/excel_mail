# excel_mail
a system using which you can send the mail is all the email id's are given in a csv file(excelsheet) . The format of the csv
file must be taken into care , otherwise script needed to be changed according to the csv file format . Right now only mail 
messages can be send. Subjects and attachement cannot as of now.
